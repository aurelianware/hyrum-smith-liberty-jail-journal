Saturday, March 30, 1839 â€” Liberty Jail

Brothers Ripley and Kimball arrived via the Jefferson valley. We petitioned Judge Turnham for a writ of habeas corpus but were denied for lack of time.
The people seem more friendly. On Sunday the 31st I suffered a painful earache. We are weary of prison and hope to be moved by Saturday, April 6.
