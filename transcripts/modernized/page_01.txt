Friday, March 15, 1839 â€” Liberty Jail

We remain in close confinement. Some visit us out of curiosity; many brethren and sisters come to minister to our needs.
Thomas Barnard has passed to heaven. Brothers Alpheus Ripley, Heber C. Kimball, William Huntington, Joseph B. Noble, and Sister [Ball?] visited.
