[Liberty Jail] March the 30th 1839.

In the morning Brother Ripley & Brother Kimball came here down the valley of Jefferson.
We sought a writ of habeas corpus of Judge Turnham, one of the Supreme Judges, but did not obtain it for lack of time with the Judge.
The people here seem to be friendly.
Sunday the 31st â€” I was sick with the ear ache and swelling in it, very painful.
We feel weary of this prison, yet hope to move next Saturday, the 6th of April.
