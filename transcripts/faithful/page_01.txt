[Liberty Jail] Friday, the 15th of March 1839.

This is the fifteenth of March and we are in close confinement.
Many call to view us as they think an [object of] curiosity.
Many of our brethren & sisters call to see us & to administer to our necessities.
Thomas Barnard is in Heaven.
Brother A. Ripley & H. C. Kimball, Wm. Huntington, Joseph B. Noble & Sister [Ball?].
