**Edited and Introduced by Mark Phillips**

---

### 📜 Project Overview
This digital edition is part of an ongoing effort to preserve and reexamine the historical legacy of **Joseph and Hyrum Smith** through primary documents presented in full fidelity to their original form.  

In this first volume — *Hyrum Smith: Journal from Liberty Jail (March–April 1839)* — each page of the surviving manuscript is carefully reproduced, transcribed, and contextualized to illuminate Hyrum’s voice during a pivotal moment of religious persecution and constitutional testing in the early republic.  

This project views the Liberty Jail period not as a story of rebellion or fanaticism, but as a testament to **moral courage, family loyalty, and the defense of conscience** against the misuse of power.  
It is offered freely to scholars, descendants, and all who seek to understand the ideals of liberty, law, and divine justice that shaped the Restoration and the broader American experiment.
