# Transcription Method

- **Faithful transcription** preserves original spelling, capitalization, punctuation, line breaks, and page divisions.
- **Modernized reading** normalizes spelling and punctuation lightly for clarity without changing meaning.
- Unreadable letters are indicated with square brackets and a question mark (e.g., `[word?]`). Editorial insertions appear in `[brackets]`.
- Dates and proper names are preserved as written; uncertain identifications are footnoted in the compiled PDF.
