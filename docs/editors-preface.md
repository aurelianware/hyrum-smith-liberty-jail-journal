# Editor’s Preface

As I have studied these pages of my ancestor’s hand, I have come to see Hyrum Smith not merely as a religious figure, but as a man of conscience who stood firm when liberty and faith were on trial together. His record from Liberty Jail is more than a personal journal; it is a testimony that freedom is sacred, and that truth, once spoken, must sometimes endure captivity before it prevails.

These writings reveal the heart of the Restoration as I understand it — not a pursuit of power or wealth, but the creation of a just society where none would go hungry or be denied the rights of conscience. Hyrum’s quiet strength, his loyalty to law, and his trust in divine justice show that he and his brother Joseph were not agitators, but reformers seeking to align the new American experiment with heaven’s order of liberty.

My intent in preparing this edition is to let Hyrum’s own words speak again. May those who read them feel the same reverence I have felt: that these were men who loved truth, honored God, and believed that the purest form of freedom is found in righteousness.

— Mark Phillips
