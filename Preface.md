The purpose of this edition is to preserve and present the writings of **Hyrum Smith** during his confinement in Liberty Jail (March–April 1839) with the greatest possible accuracy, dignity, and transparency.  

In preparing these pages, the guiding aim has been faithfulness to the original documents — both in their physical form and their spiritual intent. Each transcription retains Hyrum’s own spelling, punctuation, and rhythm of thought, while parallel readable versions are provided for modern audiences.  

This project rests on the conviction that **Joseph and Hyrum Smith were men of conscience and integrity**, engaged in a struggle for liberty — both spiritual and temporal — in an era still marked by the shadow of tyranny and human bondage. The Liberty Jail writings are not the lamentations of prisoners, but the meditations of patriots and prophets who viewed suffering as sanctifying and freedom as divine.  

All transcriptions have been created from verified manuscript images, maintaining original pagination and line order where discernible. Editorial marks such as `[illegible]`, `[torn]`, and `[continued on Page ...]` identify areas of uncertainty or loss. The faithful (diplomatic) version reproduces the original text exactly as written, while the modernized version offers minor normalization of capitalization, punctuation, and abbreviation for readability.  

The metadata files, glossary, and index that accompany this edition are intended to make the work transparent, extensible, and permanently accessible — both for historical scholarship and for the preservation of faith and family heritage.
